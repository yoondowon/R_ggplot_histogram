# R_ggplot_histogram
R code for drawing hisogram with ggplot2 package

## 1
```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)

data("Cars93")   
data("minn38")   

ggplot( Cars93, aes(x=Passengers)) +  geom_histogram()   
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
